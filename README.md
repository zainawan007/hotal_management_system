üè® Project Title:
Hotel Management System (Text-Based, Desktop Python Project)

üìù Project Description:
The Hotel Management System is a desktop-based, console (text-based) application developed in Python. It does not use any graphical user interface (GUI) and focuses on file handling using .txt files for storing and retrieving data. This project simulates the core functionality required to manage hotel operations such as room bookings, check-ins, check-outs, and record management in a simplified format.

The system runs in a terminal or command-line interface and provides menu-driven options for both Admin and User operations. All data (e.g., customer details, room status) is stored and updated using plain text files, demonstrating how file operations like read, write, append, and delete work in Python.

üéØ Purpose of the Project:
To practice core Python programming skills.

To understand and apply file handling (.txt) for persistent data storage.

To simulate hotel operations without a database or GUI.

To demonstrate logic building and console-based interaction.

‚ú® Key Features:
Admin Functionalities:

Add new rooms to the system.

View all room records.

Delete or update room information.

View all customer bookings.

User Functionalities:

View available rooms.

Book a room by providing name, ID, and duration.

Check-in and Check-out management.

View booking details (from stored file data).

Text File Handling:

All data such as room details, customer bookings, and status updates are stored in .txt files.

Data is read and written using standard Python open(), read(), write(), and append() functions.

Console Interface:

Fully menu-driven system with user-friendly prompts and instructions.

Error handling for invalid inputs (basic).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Python 3 ‚Äì Core programming language.

.txt File Handling ‚Äì For data storage and management.

Command Line / Terminal ‚Äì For user interaction and running the program.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
this is for only test perpose for better programming experience
This is a console-based project, no GUI elements are used.

Data is not stored in a database, but in plain .txt files.

Ideal for beginner to intermediate Python learners focusing on logic and file handling.
